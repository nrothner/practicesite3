												<p>
													In the future, I plan to pursue a career in UX Development. I have a passion around UX as well as Web Developement. I can truly say I love learning.
													<br>
													After graduate school, I hope to complete a certificate in web development to dive deeper into the field. 
													I would like to build further upon my skills and be able to build a fully functional website using just HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Themeing.
													 Currently, in my Web Authoring and Design course, I believe I will be able to acheive this goal by the end of summer session. 
													 Based on the syllabus, I think this will be an excellent course to test my knowledge and fill in the gaps.

															<h3><a href="#">Graduate Certificate</a></h3>
															<p>
																I'm looking into applying for a graduate certficate, which could perhaps turn into a second Master's degree. 
																At the moment I'm about half way done my degree, so I haven't really thought this part out, but it's a strong interest to focus deeply into Web Developement.

															<h3><a href="#">Permanent Teleworking</a></h3>
															<p>
																Because of the current situation, I've really enjoyed the time I'm saving by not having to commute to my office. 
																I'm thinking about becoming a permanent teleworker, which in turn, would allow me to get a graduate degree anywhere I choose and can relocate to attend classes in person. 
																I've found it challenging working full time while attending school simultaniously.

															<h3><a href="#">Drupal Development</a></h3>
															<p>
																Very rarely am I asked to work in Drupal as that's reserved for the hard-core web developers. 
																I'd love to understand the platform and get myself started as a real Drupal developer with code. 
																As much as I love my job, I find the coding optional part easy to forget how important real coding is.

															<h3><a href="#">SharePoint Online</a></h3>
															<p>
																I think the direction of Web Development, at least at my company, is turning into SharePoint Online. 
																I've only built one entire site in the platform so far, the the interface is extremely user-friendly, with no code required. 
																I know there's some really cool features like flows and power automate and I'd love to get better at both of those.
